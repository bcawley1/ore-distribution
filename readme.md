# Miner's Guide
## A client side Minecraft mod using [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/), that implements a couple of UI-based elements to help guide players with the ore distribution system in Minecraft.

## Features
- **Text Overlay:** 
  - Overlays text on the screen to show what ores are available, what chance you have to find them, and which direction to go to increase that chance.
